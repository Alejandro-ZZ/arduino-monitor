# Ardu monitor

Voltage, current, temperature and date/time monitor using Arduino pro mini (ATmega328P). Data is recorded every specific range of time (this case every 30s), saved to a microSD card and shown in a 16x2 LCD display.

## microSD files

This code writes the data read in a microSD memory through SPI communication and MicroSD Adapter that includes a level shifter. The information is recorded in a CSV  file format (Comma Separated Values) and then processed on the computer. Headers have to be created, in all memory files used, before running the system. The program uses two files: 

**1. `DATA.txt`:** in this file all main values are saved in the following format: 

  <p align="center">
    Date, Time, Battery[V], Shunt_Bat[mV], Current[A], Temperature[Â°C]
  </p>
  
Where `Shunt_Bat[mV]` is the shunt resistor voltage and `Current[A]` the current taken from the battery.

**2. `LOG.txt`:** this file is used to record every time the system is reset. This data is format as follows: 

  <p align="center">
    Date, Time, Log
  </p>

Where `Log` is the log message, in this case it'll be "Reset System".
